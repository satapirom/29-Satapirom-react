        <p className='text-lg'>I'm currently engaged in the Generation Thailand Bootcamp program as a member of the Genmate A group. 
            As an INFP (Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Perceiving) type, I possess a creative personality, characterized by a vivid imagination and a profound understanding of others. 
            Participating in this boot camp project has been both exhilarating and deeply meaningful to me. It's provided me with invaluable opportunities to learn, grow, and contribute. 
            I've embraced the challenge of setting clear goals and cultivating a mindset focused on continual self-improvement in every aspect.</p>
